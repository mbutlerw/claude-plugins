# Chalk Voice — Writing Principles

Optimise for the reader, not the writer.

Whatever you're writing — a commit, an issue, a PR description, a docs page — the reader is trying to do one of four things: acquire cognition, acquire action, apply cognition, apply action.
[Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) names these quadrants (explanation, tutorial, reference, how-to) and they apply recursively at every level, from a whole docs site down to a paragraph inside a commit body.

This file has three parts:

1. **Universal principles** — apply everywhere, regardless of quadrant.
2. **The four quadrants** — what each is for and how the voice differs.
3. **Artefacts as compositions** — which quadrants each chalk artefact (commit, issue, PR, docs page) actually occupies.

The existing chalk skills (`chalk:commit`, `chalk:pr`, `chalk`) inherit from this file — they stop reciting principles and just name their quadrant(s).

## Universal principles

These apply to all writing in this plugin's voice.

### Concrete over abstract

Ground the reasoning in specific scenarios, code snippets, data, real identifiers — not placeholders.
Abstract explanations are harder to follow and easier to misinterpret.

Not this:
> Updated the type system to better represent logical types, improving the separation between compile-time and run-time representations.

This:
> A logical type is one of: Mono (null, scalar, listy, struct), Maybe (nullable mono), or Poly (set of monos).
> Previously, VectorType represented physical types — the compile-time type and run-time type could differ because many physical representations map to one logical type.
> For physical representations, we now exclusively use Arrow's `Field` class.

### Line formatting depends on the destination

Where prose ends up shapes how to break lines.
No 80-character wrapping in either case.

**Files that get `git diff`'d — sentence per line.**
Docs pages, code comments, READMEs, any markdown checked into the repo.
Sentence-per-line keeps diffs minimal — a one-sentence edit touches one line — and makes structure easier to scan in plain source.

**Everything else — paragraph per line.**
Commit messages, issue bodies, issue comments, chalk comments, PR descriptions, progress sections — anything read primarily after rendering (GitHub, `gh`, commit views) rather than as a tracked source file.
GitHub Flavored Markdown renders single newlines as soft `<br>` breaks, so sentence-per-line fragments the rendered output into staccato lines instead of paragraphs that wrap to the viewport.
Put each paragraph on a single line, separate paragraphs with a blank line, and let the rendering wrap.

The split is `git diff`, not the artefact.
A docs page goes sentence-per-line because reviewers read its diff.
A commit message goes paragraph-per-line because nobody diffs it — they read it rendered in `git log`, GitHub, or a PR commit list.

### Lead with the problem or context

Set up *why this matters* before the solution.
The reader needs the situation before the fix makes sense.
This applies across quadrants — a how-to opens with the goal, an explanation opens with what needs explaining, a reference block sits under the concept it references.

### Be concise — but keep the reasoning

A terse note with no *why* is just as unhelpful as a verbose one.
When the reasoning is complex but the change is simple, say so.
"Simple change in the end: ..." helps the reader calibrate.

### No marketing fluff

"Powerful", "seamless", "blazing-fast", "revolutionary" — cut them.
State the capability; let the reader draw the conclusion.

### Discover project conventions, don't impose them

Version markers, changelog shapes, file layout, cross-link style — these vary between projects.
Read the docs README, existing pages, and recent commits before writing, and match what's there.

## The four quadrants

Diataxis's axes: **acquisition vs application** × **cognition vs action**.

| | Acquire | Apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cognition** | Explanation | Reference |
| **Action** | Tutorial | How-to |

### Explanation — acquire cognition

The reader wants to *understand*.
Mental models, why-this-way, decisions, tradeoffs, dead ends, invariants.

**Voice:**
- Discursive.
  Grounded in concrete examples that ground abstractions.
- Lead with the problem or the concept you're explaining.
- Capture the *why*, not the *what* — the reader can see the what elsewhere (the diff, the config, the code).
- Teach the mental model when the change introduces or reshapes a concept.
  Don't assume the reader has the model you built up while implementing.

**What to capture:**
- **The problem first**: why this matters, before what you did.
- **Decisions and tradeoffs**: why X over Y, what constraints drove the choice.
- **Counter-intuitive findings**: anything that surprised you or would surprise a developer familiar with the project.
- **Dead ends**: what didn't work and why — this prevents re-investigation.
  Include *why* the wrong approach seemed right, not just that it was wrong.
- **Scope boundaries**: what was explicitly out-of-scope and why, so nobody re-opens a question you already closed.
  If there's a natural "next up", say so.
- **The mental model**: when the change introduces or reshapes a concept, explain the model — what the abstractions are, how they relate, why they're shaped this way.

**What to omit:**
- Obvious details self-evident from the diff, the code, or the issue description.
- Play-by-play of mechanical steps ("then I ran the tests", "then I edited the file").
- The journey of how you got there — optimise for the reader, not the writer.

After drafting, re-read each paragraph adversarially and ask:
- Could a reader infer this from the diff?
- Am I defending a choice the reader would accept on sight?
- Am I describing what this change doesn't do?
- Am I speculating about how users will behave?

Cut anything that answers yes.
The chalk thread and `Refs` trailers carry the journey; the body carries the destination.

**Examples.**

Not this (restates the diff):
> Made TemporalBounds fields volatile and added a snapshot method that reads both atomically.

This (captures the decision):
> Volatile over lock — simpler, lower contention, sufficient for read-mostly pattern.
> Immutable TemporalBounds + AtomicReference would be cleanest but requires changing every call site that mutates bounds — out of scope for a bugfix.

Not this (mechanical play-by-play):
> Investigated the flaky test. Found it only failed in the full suite. Added logging to narrow it down. Discovered a race condition in TemporalBounds.intersect().

This (what matters to the next person):
> Initially suspected a test ordering issue since it only failed in the full suite — red herring.
> The full suite just increases thread contention enough to trigger a race in TemporalBounds.intersect(), which reads validFrom and validTo non-atomically.

Not this (obvious from the diff):
> Added a new `resolveTimeout` parameter to the `QueryConfig` class and threaded it through to the executor.

This (why it exists):
> Queries against the Kafka log can stall indefinitely when a partition leader is mid-election.
> A per-query timeout lets callers fail fast rather than blocking on a cluster event they can't control.

Not this (states the fix without the problem):
> This PR changes UPDATE to not create new rows when all values remain the same.

This (problem first, with a concrete example and explicit scope):
> UPDATE was creating duplicate rows even when no values actually changed.
> Uses type-strict equality — `UPDATE docs SET a = 1.0 WHERE _id = 1` on a doc with `{:a 1}` *will* create a new record because `1 ≠ 1.0`.
> PATCH is out of scope of this PR (see #5030).

### How-to — apply action

The reader has a goal and wants to *achieve it*.
Deployment, configuration, integration, a specific operational task.

**Voice:**
- Goal stated up top: "To do X, ...".
- Numbered, imperative steps.
- Terse — no narrative padding.
- Concrete identifiers, not placeholders (`my-kafka`, not `cluster-name`).
- Prerequisites and assumptions stated before the steps, not mid-flow.
- A closing "you should now see …" check, so the reader knows whether it worked.

How-tos don't teach — they assume the reader already has enough cognition to recognise the steps.
If the reader needs to *understand* something first, that's an explanation, and it belongs in a different section (or a different page).

### Reference — apply cognition

The reader is working and needs to *look something up*.
A CLI flag, an API signature, a config key, a SQL clause.

**Voice:**
- Neutral, exhaustive, structured.
- Tables, definition lists, grammar productions.
- No narrative, no "we"/"you".
- Alphabetised or structurally ordered (not narratively ordered).
- Complete — every flag, every field, every case.
- **Keep rationale out of the body.** This is the one quadrant where chalk's usual "always capture the why" does not apply inline. 
  The *why* — tradeoffs, motivation, upgrade story — belongs in an adjacent explanation section or changelog block, not next to the definition. 
  A reader looking up a flag wants the semantics, not the story behind it.

Reference is unforgiving: if it's incomplete, the reader gets burned.
Better to generate it from the source of truth (schema, CLI help, spec) than to hand-write and drift.

Watch for rationale that drifts in unnoticed — phrases like *"This exists for compatibility with..."*, *"These functions are provided so that..."*, *"This was added because..."* are explanation quadrant sentences wearing reference clothing.
Strip them, or relocate them to the adjacent changelog or explainer.

### Tutorial — acquire action

The reader is new and wants to *learn by doing*.
A guided first experience.

**Voice:**
- Gentle pacing, small wins, hand-holding.
- "You should see X" after each step, so the reader can confirm progress.
- Friendly and reassuring — confidence-building.
- Single working path — no branching ("or you could do Y"), no optionality.
- Ends with a clear next step ("now that you've done X, try Y").

Tutorials are the hardest quadrant to get right.
Explanation can be shortened; reference can be incomplete; a bad tutorial *strands the reader* and they don't come back.

## Artefacts as compositions

Most things you write aren't one quadrant — they're a composition.
Each paragraph, section, or code block does one quadrant's job; don't blur them.

**Commit bodies** are **explanation** artefacts, end-to-end.
The diff is the code change, not a reference section inside the commit.
Open with the problem (explanation framing), deliver the reasoning (explanation payload).

**Issue descriptions** are **explanation** artefacts, with reference-shaped evidence embedded (log excerpts, stack traces, block dumps).
The evidence is illustrative material inside the explanation; it's not a separate reference section.

**PR descriptions** are **explanation** artefacts.
Context, decisions, tradeoffs, dead ends, scope — all explanation.
Usage examples, test-plan checklists, and commit lists have a reference *shape* but they're illustrations embedded in explanation, not standalone reference.

**Docs pages** play all four.
Each page leans toward one quadrant at the top level; sections within it may hit other quadrants.
A how-to page often has a short explanation intro (what this setup is for), numbered steps (how-to), a commented config block (reference), and a closing section on failure modes (explanation).
Each section does one quadrant's job; they don't blur together.

The test isn't "where does this page live?"
It's "what is *this paragraph/section* for?"

## A note on the skills

The chalk skills (`chalk:commit`, `chalk:pr`, the core `chalk` skill, and eventually `chalk:docs`) don't restate the rules in this file.
They name the quadrant(s) they cover and inherit the voice.

This keeps guidance in one place and lets the skills stay short.
